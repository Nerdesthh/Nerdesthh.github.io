<h1 align = "center"> HELLO WORLD! </h1>

<p align="center"> This is going to be my main website! YAHOO!!! <br><br> A I don't plan being a web developer, I just want to create my own with my own knowledge, even storing for my portfolio during my college career. <br>(serious student) <br><br>
I love programmming, I really do! I will update this website frequently until its done, then focus on my side projects!! HTML and CSS are just a markup language and a style language. EASY TO LEARN, but needs time to perfect!
